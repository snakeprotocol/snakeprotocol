# This workflow is triggered by a comment on an issue or PR with the text ".bundle"
# It bundles the Desktop App, then creates a PR comment with a link to download the app.

# IMPORTANT: issue_comment workflows only use files found on "main" branch to run.
# Do NOT allow on: pull_request since that allows a user to alter a file in a PR and exfil secrets for example.
# Only using issue_comment is the suggested workflow type. Comments on pull requests, and issues will trigger the issue_comment workflow event.
