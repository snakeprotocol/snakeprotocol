## Exciting Features of Goose 1.0 Beta

### 1. Transition to Rust

The core of Goose has been rewritten in Rust. Why does this matter? Rust allows for a more portable and stable experience. This change means that Goose can run smoothly on different systems without the need for Python to be installed, making it easier for anyone to start using it.

### 2. Contextual Memory

Goose will remember previous interactions to better understand ongoing projects. This means you won’t have to keep repeating yourself. Imagine having a conversation with someone who remembers every detail—this is the kind of support Goose aims to offer.

### 3. Improved Plugin System

In Goose v1.0, the Goose toolkit system is being replaced with Systems. Systems are modular daemons that Goose can interact with dynamically. As a result, Goose will be able to support more complex plugins and integrations. This will make it easier to extend Goose with new features and functionality.

### 4. Headless mode

You can now run Goose in headless mode - this is useful for running Goose on servers or in environments where a graphical interface is not available.

```sh
cargo run --bin goose -- run -i instructions.md
```

### 5. Goose now has a GUI

Goose now has an electron-based GUI macOS application that provides and alternative to the CLI to interact with Goose and manage your projects.

### 6. Goose alignment with open protocols

Goose v1.0 Beta now uses a custom protocol, that is designed in parallel with [Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) (MCP) to communicate with Systems. This makes it possible for developers to create their own systems (e.g Jira, ) that Goose can integrate with.
