   │  ● Anthropic (Claude and other models from Anthropic)
   │  ○ Databricks 
   │  ○ Google Gemini 
   │  ○ Groq 
   │  ○ Ollama 
   │  ○ OpenAI

    3. Click Edit, enter your API key, and click `Set as Active`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Local LLMs (Ollama)

Ollama provides local LLMs, which requires a bit more set up before you can use it with Goose.

1. [Download Ollama](https://ollama.com/download). 
2. Run any [model supporting tool-calling](https://ollama.com/search?c=tools):

:::warning Limited Support for models without tool calling
Goose extensively uses tool calling, so models without it (e.g. `DeepSeek-r1`) can only do chat completion. If using models without tool calling, all Goose [extensions must be disabled](/docs/getting-started/using-extensions#enablingdisabling-extensions). As an alternative, you can use a [custom DeepSeek-r1 model](/docs/getting-started/using-goose-free#deepseek-r1) we've made specifically for Goose.
:::

Example:

```sh
ollama run qwen2.5
```

3. In a separate terminal window, configure with Goose:

```sh
goose configure
```

4. Choose to `Configure Providers`

```
┌   goose-configure 
│
◆  What would you like to configure?
│  ● Configure Providers (Change provider or update credentials)
│  ○ Toggle Extensions 
│  ○ Add Extension 
└  
```

5. Choose `Ollama` as the model provider

```
┌   goose-configure 
│
◇  What would you like to configure?
│  Configure Providers 
│
◆  Which model provider should we use?
│  ○ Anthropic 
│  ○ Databricks 
│  ○ Google Gemini 
│  ○ Groq 
│  ● Ollama (Local open source models)
│  ○ OpenAI 
│  ○ OpenRouter 
└  
```
