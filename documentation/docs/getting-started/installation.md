  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    There isn't native installation support for Windows, however you can run Goose using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

    1. Open [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows) as Administrator and install WSL and the default Ubuntu distribution:

    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```

    2. Restart your computer if prompted.

    3. Run the Goose installation script:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://github.com/block/goose/releases/download/stable/download_cli.sh | bash
    ```
    :::tip
      If you encounter any issues on download, you might need to install `bzip2` to extract the downloaded file:

      ```bash
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install bzip2 -y
      ```

## Set LLM Provider
Goose works with a set of [supported LLM providers][providers], and you’ll need an API key to get started. When you use Goose for the first time, you’ll be prompted to select a provider and enter your API key.

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Goose CLI" default>
    Upon installing, Goose will automatically enter its configuration screen. Here is where you can set up your LLM provider.

    :::tip Windows Users
    Choose to not store to keyring when prompted.
    :::

    Example:

    ```
    ┌   goose-configure
    │
    ◇ What would you like to configure?
    │ Configure Providers
    │
    ◇ Which model provider should we use?
    │ OpenAI
    │
    ◇ Provider openai requires OPENAI_API_KEY, please enter a value
    │▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪▪
    │    
    ◇ Enter a model from that provider:
    │ gpt-4o
    │
    ◇  Welcome aboard! You're all set to start using this agent—let's achieve great things together!
    │
    └  Configuration saved successfully
  ```

  :::info Windows Users
  On initial run, you may encounter errors about keyrings when setting your API Keys. Set the needed environment variables manually, e.g.:

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY={your_google_api_key}
  ```

  To make the changes persist in WSL across sessions, add the goose path and export commands to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file so you can load it later.

  ```bash
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
  echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
